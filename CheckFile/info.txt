This function is designed to check the existence of a file and answers the
question: "The file does not exist ??".


The function can also answer the questions: "Will the file be closed?" and
"Can't read the file?".


If you need to know the answer to the question:
  "The file does not exist?" - You can substitute the result of
"CheckFile(AddressFile)" into the "bool()" function. "False" and "None" - No,
"True" - Yes. "bool(CheckFile(AddressFile))".
  "The file is unreadable, is it?" - The answer will be in the return type.
NoneType - Yes, bool - No. "type(CheckFile(AddressFile)) == None".
  "Will the file be closed?" - use the functionality: "try", "except".


The function can understand and return 4 events:
  The file is missing. "True".
  The file exists and is being read. "False".
  File exists but cannot be read. "None".
  The file is not closed (exception - TheFileDidntClose).


In addition to 3 events (from "return"), there is 1 more Exception
(TheFileDidntClose - from "raise") - says that the file is not closed.


Arsenal: 2 bool values. 1 NoneType and 1 Exception.


Events:
  File exists: "None" - the file was not read. "False" - the file has been read.
  File does not exist: "True".
  The file is not closed: "TheFileDidntClose".


If you do not need some functionality, you have the right to remove it (if you
understand what you are doing).
