# File deletion function.


<h4>What can you expect from her:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>'True' - the file existed and was deleted (the address is correct).</li>
 <li>'False' - The file did not exist and was not deleted (wrong address).</li>
 <li>'Exception' or 'None' - file exists and has not been deleted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>On A Note:</h4>
<ul>
 <li>If you use the function only for the effect of deleting a file,
  then in this case: both False and True say: The specified file no longer
  exists at the specified address.</li>
</ul>
